        Modern Korean is written in the Korean script (한글; Hangul in South
        Korea, 조선글; Chosŏn'gŭl in North Korea), a system developed during the
        15th century for that purpose, although it did not become the primary
        script until the 20th century. The script uses 24 basic letters (jamo)
        and 27 complex letters formed from the basic ones.
        <br />
        <br />
        When first recorded in historical texts, Korean was only a spoken
        language; all written records were maintained in Hanmun or classical
        Chinese along with invented phoentic scripts like as Idu, Gugyeol and
        Hyangchal. Later, written Chinese characters adapted to the Korean
        language, Hanja (漢字), were used to write the language for most of
        Korea's history and are still used to a limited extent in South Korea,
        most prominently in the humanities and the study of historical texts.

        Kangoo Jumps Rebound exercise (or “rebounding”) is a type of elastically
        leveraged low-impact exercise usually performed on a device known as a
        rebounder—sometimes called a "mini-trampoline" or "fitness
        trampoline"—which is directly descended from regular sports or athletic
        trampolines.

        <br />
        <br />
        Some of the basic movements and actions of rebound exercise include
        bouncing in place (sometimes also called "jumping" or the Health
        Bounce[1]), jumping jacks, twists, side-to-side motions, running in
        place, dance movements, and a wide variety of other movements, patterned
        or un-patterned, with or without the use of hand-weights or other
        accessories. A wide variety of physical and other benefits are claimed
        for rebound exercise, which experienced a tremendous upsurge of
        interest[2] in the mid-1980s.

        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, 鮓, pronounced [sɯɕiꜜ] or [sɯꜜɕi] ⓘ) is a
        Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually
        with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients (ねた,
        neta), such as seafood — often raw — and vegetables. Styles of sushi and
        its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi
        rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).

        <br />
        <br />
        The creator of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented
        nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is
        placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period
        (1603–1867). It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.
